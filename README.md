September UPDATE:

I struggled quite a bit with getting going with this project.  A lot of credit and influence came from YouTubers Bro Code, Code with Ania Kubow, and Web Dev Simplified.  I studied their code, followed along with their tutorials, and used concepts they used that made the most sense to me with the knowledge I currently have.

I still am a bit rusty with factory functions and the module pattern, and plan to review that section again, now having a better understanding of how they can be implemented.
